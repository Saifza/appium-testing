#Appium Steps

1. Open Appium server GUI
   set Host 127.0.0.1
       Port 4723
        check edit configuation to ensure if JAVA_HOME and ANDROID_HOME are correct.
  start server

2.Open android studio
   use device manager to run a device 

3. Open appium inspector  (the purspose of Appium inspector is to inspect element to find id after any app is opened)
   set Remote Host = localhost
       Remote Path = /wd/hub
       Remote Port = 4723

   set desiredcapabilities  
           deviceName  = value (the device name from the android studio)
           platfromName = android

   then start session
the device will be shown, and when an App is opened in the virtual device in android studio it opens in the inspector as well. After that element ids can be found using the appium inspector.

4. to test any App  4 capabilites need to be set.
         DesiredCapabilities cap = new DesiredCapabilities();
	cap.setCapability("appium:deviceName","Pixel_XL_API_30");
        cap.setCapability("platformName", "Android");
        cap.setCapability("appium:appPackage", "com.google.android.calculator");  
        cap.setCapability("appium:appActivity", "com.android.calculator2.Calculator");
        String url= "http://127.0.0.1:4723/wd/hub";
    	
        driver = new RemoteWebDriver(new URL(url), cap);  

appPackage and appActivity can be found by running the following command on cmd
    adb devices 
    adb shell
    dumpsys window displays | grep -E 'mCurrentFocus|mFocusedApp'
